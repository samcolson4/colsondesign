## A personal website by *Sam Colson*

[colsondesign.com](http://www.colsondesign.com)

This website is not yet public and for now just re-directs to my github page. 

It is being built using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

## Purpose & design
Currently, the website's main purpose is to teach me the beginnings of using Rails, following online guides. I have previously experimented with Django, so have some concept of the Model-View-Controller hierachy, but want to see how this translates to a Ruby-driven deployment. 

The website will eventually house my blog and act as a showcase for some of my software development work. 

In terms of design, I feel like the web has become a bit too clean and minimalist over recent years. As Apple's stock goes up, so does the weight everyone puts on their (excellent) design choices. However, I'm all for a bit of counter-culture, so this site may end up being quite out there, drawing some inspiration from [Blackbird Spyplane](https://blackbirdspyplane.substack.com). Regardless of the eventual look, the site will comply with the latest accesibility standards so that it can be enjoyed by all.

## Deployment
To run a local version, clone this repo and run 'rails server'. Depending on security, I may remove certain files from GitHub and prevent local deployment, but as I am just in a testing phase for now it works using the files available in this repo. It will however require the [rails gem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-installation.htm) to be installed.
