<p>This website is a work in progress personal website for <a href="https://github.com/samcolson4">Sam Colson</a>.</p>
<p>The website's main purpose is to teach me the beginnings of using Rails, following online guides. I have previously experimented with Django, so have some concept of the Model-View-Controller hierachy, but want to see how this translates to a Ruby-driven deployment.</p>

<p>The website will eventually house my blog and act as a showcase for some of my software development work.</p>
